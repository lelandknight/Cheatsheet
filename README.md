# Color Cheatsheet

### What the project does
This project was part of the curriculum for the Full Stack Developer course by Codecademy. The goal of the project was to have the student create their own cheatsheet with the topic being something we have learned so far in the course and create a table to cover the topic.
I chose to create a cheatsheet over the different ways to select colors for your website. It goes over each type of color choice, how it is formatted in your CSS document and how it works and understand how to change colors.

### Why the project is useful
Creating this project really help to reinforce how to create tables and the structure in html. It is also helpful in that I can now quickly reference this cheatsheet in the future to use colors to my advantage on a website.
